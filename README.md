## Content

Now, what is this about?

This is an project that concludes the Udemy course "The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery" and consist of a
web application that allows the user to submit url from images and get back bounding boxes that encompass the faces in the
picture thanks to the API Clarifai Face Model.

For the user to access that tough, he needs to register in the site. To register he needs to input his name, email and 
password, that will be stored in a PostgreSQL database, so that later he can sign in again. And one unique email will be
needed for each account, and also, the number of photos that he submitted will be remembered too.

Finally, the controllers make sure that the password is properly hashed before inputting it at the database, and make a 
properly validation check of the content to be stored.

## Host
